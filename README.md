## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an aspiring **Data Engineer** passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful, business-ready insights. Currently focused on building a strong foundation in **data acquisition, cleaning, and transformation** through hands-on projects and continuous learning.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, automation, and analytics**, and I'm motivated by how reliable data pipelines enable smarter decision-making. Through practical projects and structured learning, I'm steadily progressing toward my goal of becoming a **Cloud Data Engineer** capable of designing scalable and efficient data solutions.

```python
class DataEngineer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Qasim"
        self.role = "Aspiring Cloud Data Engineer"
        self.location = "Karachi, Pakistan"
        self.current_focus = ["ETL Pipelines", "Data Modeling", "Cloud Platforms"]
        self.learning = ["AWS", "Snowflake", "Apache Airflow"]
    
    def say_hi(self):
        print("Thanks for dropping by! Let's build something amazing with data.")

me = DataEngineer()
me.say_hi()
```

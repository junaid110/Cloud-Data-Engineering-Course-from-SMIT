# Banggood Product Data Pipeline — Data Engineering Hackathon Project

A complete end‑to‑end **Data Engineering Hackathon Project** I built in one 12‑hour coding night during my SMIT program. The project includes **web scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, SQL storage, analytics, and visualizations** — designed exactly like a real‑world mini data pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project collects product data from **Banggood.com** using Python and transforms it into a clean dataset ready for analysis and database storage.

### **Key Steps:**

* Web Scraping using **Requests + BeautifulSoup**
* Cleaning & preprocessing messy data (price, reviews, ratings)
* Feature engineering (Price per Review, Rating Flags, Price Category)
* Exploratory Data Analysis using **Pandas + Matplotlib**
* Storing cleaned data into **SQL Server** using PyODBC
* SQL queries for insights and aggregations
* Visualizations for value products and category stats
